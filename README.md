# Professional README Generator

## Description

A command line application that asks the user a series of questions, then generatores a professional README with their answers and saves it locally using markdown.

## How To Use

type `npm start` in the terminal. The terminal will ask you a series of questions. Type or select your answers with the keyboard. A file called `README.md` will be generated in `./output/`. That's all :D
